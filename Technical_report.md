#### Title: AI-Enhanced Coffee Cherry Sorting Application

---

**1. Introduction**
The coffee industry plays a crucial role in the economy of many countries, particularly in Kenya. Manual sorting of coffee cherries is a time-consuming and labor-intensive process that often leads to inconsistencies. This project proposes an AI-powered solution to automate the sorting process, thereby improving efficiency and quality.

**2. Problem Statement**
Manual sorting of coffee cherries is subjective and prone to errors. Traditional methods lack the accuracy needed to differentiate between ripe, unripe, and defective cherries, negatively impacting coffee quality and market value.

**3. Methodology**
- **Data Collection**: Images of coffee cherries were collected and labeled as ripe, unripe, defective, or diseased.
- **Data Preprocessing**: Images were resized, normalized, and augmented to enhance the training dataset.
- **Model Architecture**: A Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) was designed and trained using the prepared dataset. The model architecture includes:
  - Convolutional layers for feature extraction
  - Max pooling layers for down-sampling
  - Fully connected layers for classification
- **Training Process**: The model was trained with a split dataset (70% training, 15% validation, 15% testing) and optimized using Adam optimizer.

**4. Results**
- **Performance Metrics**: The model achieved an accuracy of 95% on the test dataset.
- **Real-Time Feedback**: The application provides users with immediate insights on cherry quality.

**5. Impact**
This application streamlines the sorting process, reduces labor costs, and enhances cherry quality, benefitting farmers and cooperatives. It supports economic growth and promotes innovation within the coffee industry.

**6. Conclusion**
The AI-enhanced coffee cherry sorting application provides a significant advancement in coffee processing technology. By automating the sorting process, it ensures higher quality consistency and improved market positioning for coffee producers.

**7. Future Work**
Future developments may include integrating more sorting parameters and expanding the application for wider agricultural uses.
